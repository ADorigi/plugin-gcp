## Overview


- **Ease of use**: One-line command. Use without modifying workloads or making configuration changes.
- **Base on actual Usage**: Analyzes the past seven days of usage from Cloud native monitoring (CloudWatch), including advanced AWS CloudWatch metrics (where available).
- **Customize**: Optimize for region, CPU, memory, network performance, storage, licenses, and more to match your specific requirements.
- **Secure** - no credentials to share; extracts required metrics from the client side
- **Open-core philosophy** Use without fear of lock-in. The CLI is open-sourced, and the Server side will be open-sourced soon.
- **Coming Soon**: Non-Interactive mode, Azure support, GPU Optimization, Credit utilization for Burst instances, and Observability data from Prometheus
